EXERCISE APPLYING DATA STRUCTURE TECHNIQUES
Assignment:
Build a web application to manage products and shopping carts using MVC architecture.
Model 2 (Servlet + JSP + JavaBean + DAO), using MySQL as the database.
Required:
1. Products table in MySQL with the following columns:
○ id (INT, PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
○ name (VARCHAR)
○ price (DECIMAL)
○ description (TEXT)
2. Create Models:
○ Product (JavaBean)
○ ProductDAO (JDBC) with full CRUD support.

3. Improve DAO layer performance:
○ Use the ConcurrentHashMap<Integer,
Product> data structure to cache products by ID.

○ Clearly describe when to read from the cache, when to read from the database, and when to update the cache.

4. Controller:
○ ProductServlet handles all /products requests with actions:
list, new, edit, delete, save (or equivalent).

○ The Servlet calls the DAO (Model), then forwards it to the JSP (View).

5. View (JSP):
○ product-list.jsp: displays a list of products, with Add/Edit/Delete links and an “Add to Cart” button.

○ product-form.jsp: a general form for adding/editing products.

○ The JSP uses JSTL + EL, not scriptlets.

6. Cart:
○ Creates a CartItem (Product + quantity) and stores the Cart in the session.

○ The cart must use Map<Integer, CartItem> to manage

products by productId, explaining the reason for choosing Map instead of List.

○ Create a CartServlet to:
■ Add products to the cart
■ Update the quantity
■ Remove a product
■ Clear the entire cart
■ View the cart
○ Create a cart.jsp file to display the list of items, total quantity, total price, and update/delete buttons.

7. Analysis (write in comments):
○ Explain why you are using:
■ ConcurrentHashMap for product caching
■ LinkedHashMap / Map for the shopping cart
■ ArrayList for the returned list
○ Analyze the time complexity (Big-O) for some typical operations:
■ Search for products by cached ID
■ Add products to the cart (addProduct)
■ Update the quantity in the cart (updateQuantity)
Learning Objectives:
● Apply MVC 2 techniques in a real-world web application.

● Know how to combine Data Structures (Map/List/ConcurrentHashMap…) to improve performance.

● Know how to clearly separate Model – View – Controller, preventing JSPs from directly accessing the database.

● Know how to use sessions to manage the shopping cart status.
